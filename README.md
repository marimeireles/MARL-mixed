This is an extension of [pyCRLD]() in which I aim to develop environments that foster interactions between heterogeneous agents.
The repository is created with the aim of facilitating experimentation.

The base files that weren't modified were simply copied over as Python generated files from the original repository and lie in the `pyCRLD` directory.

All the files that have their correspondent notebook here were modified in order to have this branch of pyCRLD.

In order to run these files make sure you have an environment with the software especified on the `settings.ini`.
